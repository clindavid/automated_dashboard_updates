# Automated updates to dashboards deployed on shinyserver    

The Automated updates to shiny dashboards on shinyserver pdf has the instructions and various components that make up the system. 
Besides the shiny-server configuration, we need to set up a Django REST API - consider checking the [Django_Intro repo](https://github.com/clindavid/Django_Intro) which has some introductory notes on how to set it up. Rest of the needful are on the pdf slides on this repo.
